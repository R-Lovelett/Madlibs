# What I Learned
This program was one of my first projects completed while following an online tutorial by Kylie Ying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg&t=1465s . Since completing the tutorial though, I have revisited this to add some additional features and to expand on the concept after learning some more Python syntax.

At the time of writing this, I am new to coding in Python, and this project was a great way to get used to the coding syntax of Python while also learning how Python code is executed on a machine compared to a compile language like Java.
